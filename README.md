## food-in-x

Over the last few months [I enjoyed reviewing places](http://janoelze.de/food-in-hamburg/), I went to eat at in Hamburg. Partly to keep track of venues I liked, partly to assamble a general list of good restaurants, bars, etc in the city.

Since I'm not good at judging and filtering commercially interested food recommendations done by i.e. travel magazines, I'd like to see these personal lists pop up for other cities.

So, please go ahead and throw PHP code above on your server and review places you deem worth checking out.

## Installation

* Download the [code](https://github.com/janoelze/food-in/archive/master.zip).
* Upload it to a PHP server (5.3+) of your choice. 
* Update the config in the index.php file, so that it matches your setup.
	* *Optional: Modify the existing theme or create your own. If HTML and CSS is not your thing: A default theme is in the making.*
* That's it, I think.

## Todo
 * Add a nicer default theme
 
## Notes

Since I miss the times of blogrolls I'd be happy to link to your food-in-x site in the footer of [janoelze.de/food-in-hamburg/](http://janoelze.de/food-in-hamburg/). Drop me a line at [jan@codein.is](mailto:jan@codein.is) with the URL to your site.
